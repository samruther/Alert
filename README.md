# Alert
Inform user of happenings within their home environment and eventually expand out to include wherever they're at. The alerts will notifiy users of happenings through their smartphones via an application. Will eventually create the application to work on any platform. The primary target audience of this application are those who have some sort of hearing loss though that's not to say that everyeone can't benefit from it in some way. In order to set up the application, some kind of communication needs to take place from the device or appliance or other sound creating activity (i.e. knocking at door) and so some kind of small, easily configurable, communication device may need to be developed unless an existing software exist (i.e. water heater).
